# Makers Academy week 4: Bookmark Manager

This week's project is a bookmark manager. The goal is to expose you to the following aspects of web development:

* Relational databases
* Security considerations
* More feature testing with Capybara

In addition to the technologies mentioned above, this project is going to be more challenging on the front-end. The task was to build a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit, as a good use case for exploring how relational databases work.

A boomark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

Setup
--------
This project was completed using TDD and pairing. The daily changing pair programming nature of Maker's means that the project code base can change on a daily basis. Therefore, there are seperate (often ophan) branches for each session and these have not been merged due to differences in approach.
